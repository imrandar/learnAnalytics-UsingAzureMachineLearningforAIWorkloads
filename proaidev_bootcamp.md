# Welcome

Welcome to the second two days of the Cloud AI Bootcamp. In these two days, we will focus on hands-on activities that develop proficiency in AI-oriented workflows leveraging Azure Machine Learning Workbench and Services, the Team Data Science Process, Visual Studio Team Services, and Azure Container Services. These labs assume a introductory to intermediate knowledge of these services, and if this is not the case, then you should spend the time working through the pre-requisites.

# Pre-requisites

Pre-requisites can be found [here][prereq3.0]. Briefly, pre-requisites include the following:

## Resources

- The ability to create resources within an Azure subscription
- Familiarity with how to create resources in said subscription

## Azure Machine Learning Services

- Python Proficiency and familiarity with data science workloads and techniques.

## Version Control

- Familiarity with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and a [Visual Studio Team Services Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/visual-studio-team-services/) to leverage collaborative features of Azure Machine Learning.

## Languages

- Python

# Goals

- Understand and use the Team Data Science Process (TDSP) to clearly define business goals and success criteria
- Use a code-repository system with the Azure Machine Learning Workbench using the TDSP structure
- Create an example environment
- Use the TDSP and AMLS for data acquisition and understanding
- Use the TDSP and AMLS for creating an experiment with a model and evaluation of models
- Use the TDSP and AMLS for deployment
- Use the TDSP and AMLS for project close-out and customer acceptance
- Execute Data preparation workflows and train your models on remote Data Science Virtual Machines (with or without GPUs) and HDInsight Clusters running Spark
- Manage and compare models with Azure Machine Learning
- Explore hyper-parameters on Spark using Azure Machine Learning
- Deploy and Consume a scoring service on Azure Container Service
- Collect and Analyze data from a scoring service in production to progress the data science lifecycle.
